    <h3>Lab Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of Lab 8 was to perform a stunt, either a flip or drifting with our cars. I chose to perform a flip
      with
      my robot.

    <h3>FLipping</h3>
    <p>
      A Kalman filter is an algorithm that optimally estimates a system's state by balancing predictions with new
      measurements. It works by continuously forecasting where a system should be, then adjusting this prediction when
      actual measurements arrive. The filter intelligently weights each data source based on their estimated
      reliability,
      making it particularly effective for noisy environments.

      This is the second flip.

    <p>
      The velocity graph was quite noisy as can be seen above. However, by ignoring the beginning noisy section the last
      few data points show some steady state. By zooming into that part of the graph the steady state velocity of the
      system was estimated to be around ~230 mm/s. To find the 90% rise time, I plotted the 90% steady state velocity on
      the graph, which was 207 mm/s, and found the intersection point on the x-axis. This was found to be ~1.2s.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This lab was very useful in understanding how I can use the Kalman filtering to help improve my PID controller.
      Implementing the filter in Python first was super helpful in understanding how different parameters of the filter
      affect the output. It was super cool to see the KF outputs matching up with the actual sensor outputs as well ! I
      hope I can improve on the tuning and get the controller to work better.

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>
      I referenced Stephan Wagner and Mikayla Lahr's work for Lab 7. Further, Jennie Redrovan, Lulu Htutt and I worked
      on
      this lab together and collaborated while figuring out the Kalman Filter implementation.
