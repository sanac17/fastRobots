    <h3>Lab Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of Lab 4, was to get attach our motor driver controllers to our car and start working on open loop
      control of our car. The motor drivers will be used to control our car.

    <h3>Lab Set-up/Prelab</h3>
    <p>
      For the prelab of this class I set up code that allows bluetooth communication with the robot. I set up two main
      cases, START_PID and STOP_CAR. The START_PID controls the PID controller and sends this data back to the python
      script. START_PID sets the required distance from the wall the 3 PID constant values. I decided to use PI control
      for this lab.

    <h3>PID Control Equation</h3>
    <p>
      For this lab, we will be using the PID control equation to control the position of our robot.
      We use the equation from lecture shown below:
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="./images/pid_control_eq.png" alt="Temp readings" class="task-image">
    </div>
    <p>
      The PID equation uses 3 main constants: Kp (proportional constant), KD (derivative constant), and Ki (integral
      constant). It uses these constants and the error to calculate the new PID input value. The Proportional control
      adjusts output based on error magnitude, with larger errors causing
      stronger responses. Integral control accumulates error over time, maintaining correction even when the error
      momentarily disappears, ensuring steady-state accuracy. Derivative control responds to error rate changes,
      essentially predicting future behaviorâ€”like slowing a robot approaching a wall too quickly.

    <h3>Kp: Proportional Control</h3>
    <p>
      First, I focussed on P control and finding an appropriate Kp value. Our motor driver has PWM values in the range 0
      to 255. I decided that my car should go a maximum of 2000 mm from the wall at max speed and then begin to slow
      down. Taking scaling into consideration, I wanted a max PWM output of around 100-150. This corresponds to Kp
      values ranging from 0.05 to 0.075.
      i decided to test out a few Kp values, and saw that Kp of 0.05 semmed to work best. I also changed my ToF sensors
      to work on long distance mode since they should be able to detect the wall from 6+ feet away.

    <h3>Ki: integral Control</h3>
    <p>
      Next, I added integral control. Integral control helps ounteact steady state error.

    <h3>Additional 5000 Level Tasks</h3>
    <h4>analogWrite() frequency/PWM discussion</h4>
    <p>
      When checking on the oscilloscope, the measured time period was found to be 5.44 ms. This corresponds to a
      frequency of 183.8 Hz. Since our motor drivers sample at 50 kHz, this should be fast enough for our motors.
      Experimentally, I found that a PWM value of 40 was found to be low enough to allow the car to move. This PWM value
      is enough to sustain movement after approx 1.5 seconds.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This lab was very demanding in terms of soldering/hardware. I initally had a hard time getting the wheels on my
      car to spin and realised that my soldered connections were quite weak. Once I had resoldered and reinforced these
      connections however, I was able to get the wheels to spin much better. I also had an issue where the settings on
      the DC power supply in the lab was limiting the current my wheels were drawing. However, once I used a different,
      non current limiting channel the wheels worked much better.
