    <h2>Lab Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of Lab 1, was to get familiar with the Artemis Nano board and set-up the ble-controller to allow
      communicating with the board via blutooth.
    </p>

    <h2>Prelab Set-up</h2>
    <p>
      To set-up the lab I first downloaded the Arduino IDE and connected to the Artemis Nano board. After that, I ran
      some of the example code to test
      out uploading and running code on the board. I also got familiar with the Serial Monitor and baud rates.

    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <p>
      Task 1 was to run the Blink program on the Artemis board.

    <p>
      As can be seen in the video, the LED on the Artemis is blinking.
    </p>

    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <p>
      Task 2 was to run the Serial program on the Artemis board.

    <p>
      As can be seen in the video, the serial monitor echoes back the word typed in as input.

  <section class="task1">
    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <p>
      Task 3 was to test out the temperature sensor on the Artemis board. As can be seen in the video, covering the
      sensor with my hand led to an increase in the temperature reading.
    </p>
    <div class="video-container">

        allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
      As can be seen in the video, the temperature readings on the serial monitor increase when I put my hand around the
      board and they decrease when I take my hand off the sensor on the artemis.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="task1">
    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <p>
      Task 4 was to test out the microphone on the Artemis board. Whistling/making loud noises showed a change in the
      frequency reading on the serial monitor output.
    </p>

  <section class="task1">
    <h2>Additional 5000-level Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      The additional task was to blink the LED on the artmemis whenever a Middle-C note was played. To achieve this
      code, I combined the sample blink and PDM codes and modified it such that the LED would blink if a frequency equal
      to that of Middle-C is heard. I allowed for small variations by setting the range of detection to 260 to 265 Hz.
      (Middle-C is generally considered to be 262 Hz). As can be seen in the video, the LED only blinks when a Middle-C
      is played and not any other note.

  <section class="about">
    <h2>Prelab Set-up</h2>
    <p>
      The set-up for this lab involved setting up a virtual python environment with the nexcessary packages for the lab.
      Next, we had to set-up jupyter lab to run the lab code and set-up the necessary configurations to allow the
      artemis board to connect to our laptops. This involved replacing the MAC address and generating a new UUID so that
      our laptops only connect to our board.

    <h2>ECHO</h2>
    <p>
      Task 1 was to set-up the ECHO command to send a string value from our Python script to the artemis board. For this
      task I added a prefix to the message echoed back from the artemis, "Robot says".

    <h2>SEND_THREE_FLOATS</h2>

      Task 2 was SEND_THREE_FLOATS, to send 3 floats from the artemis board back to our Python script.

    <h2>GET_TIME_MILLIS</h2>
    <p>
      For this task I used the millis() function to generate the current time in milliseconds and send back the int
      value of the time to the computer. On the Python side, the code receives the string and prints out the time in
      milliseconds.

    <h2>Notfication Handler</h2>
    <p>
      For this task, I set up a function in the Python script called "notification_handler" that uses the uuid to
      automatically receive data from the board and print it out.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">

  <section class="task1">
    <h2>Get time loop</h2>
    <p>
      For this task, I set up a loop in the arduino code that runs for 5 seconds and generate the current time using
      millis() at every loop iteration. As soon as the time is generated, it is sent back to the python script and
      received and printed out by the notification handler.
      I used this to calculate the effective data transfer rate. In 5 seconds, 615 integer timestamps were received,
      which made the effective data transfer rate (615 * 4) / 5 = 492 bytes/sec

  <section class="task1">
    <h2>SEND_TIME_DATA</h2>
    <p>
      In this task, instead of sending all the timestamps as soon as they were produced, I created an array and put the
      values in that first in a loop that ran for 5 seconds. Then I looped through the array and sent all the data back
      at once.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">

  <section class="task1">
    <h2>GET_TEMP_READINGS</h2>
    <p>
      This task was similar to the above but instead of collecting only time data, I also stored the temp data in an
      array and sent that data back with the time data. The Python code displayed the data as timestamp:temperature
      reading.
