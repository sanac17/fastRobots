  <section class="about">
    <h2>Lab Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of Lab 1, was to get familiar with the Artemis Nano board and set-up the ble-controller to allow
      communicating with the board via blutooth.
    </p>

    <h2>Prelab Set-up</h2>
    <p>
      To set-up the lab I first downloaded the Arduino IDE and connected to the Artemis Nano board. After that, I ran
      some of the example code to test
      out uploading and running code on the board. I also got familiar with the Serial Monitor and baud rates.

    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <p>
      Task 1 was to run the Blink program on the Artemis board.

    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <p>
      Task 3 was to test out the temperature sensor on the Artemis board. As can be seen in the video, covering the
      sensor with my hand led to an increase in the temperature reading.

    <h2>Task 4</h2>

      Task 4 was to test out the microphone on the Artemis board. Whistling/making loud noises showed a change in the
      frequency reading on the serial monitor output.

    <h2>Additional 5000-level Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      The additional task was to blink the LED on the artmemis whenever a Middle-C note was played. To achieve this
      code, I combined the sample blink and PDM codes and modified it such that the LED would blink if a frequency equal
      to that of Middle-C is heard. I allowed for small variations by setting the range of detection to 260 to 265 Hz.
      (Middle-C is generally considered to be 262 Hz). As can be seen in the video, the LED only blinks when a Middle-C
      is played and not any other note.
